# C++ Image Editor

## Description
This CLI app allows a user to edit a BMP file image into one of 10 options. The project helped me improve my understanding of pixel manipulation and C++.

## Usage
Requires C++11 or later. Download the file, rename it if you like and run:
g++ -std=c++11 -o main [newfilename here].cpp && ./main

From the CLI, you can select a starting, local BMP file and then run a series of image / pixel editing functions from rotation, to black and white, to clarendon and more!
